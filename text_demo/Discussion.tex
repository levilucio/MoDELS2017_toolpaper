\emph{Notes:} 
Point can be arised that if you are generating code from the model why do we need tests? we can sell our
idea by stating that we don't necessarly want to generate the code but write the
controller requirements as EARS and somebody else can write the code. Some
engineers don't rely on automatic code generation and want to develop/build
controllers explicitly. In such a situation, test case generation would help to
perform conformance between the specified controller and its respective implementation.
