More points:
4. Code generation and synthesizer for EARS-based requirements
5. Test case generation for conformance checking of the generated controller
6. Interfacing with Matlab Simulink
5. Viewing the Results
7. Lessons learned

8. Start discussing the steps as flow model and follow exactly the same
steps!!!! 
8.1 Expression of Controller Requirements as EARS and related Models (e.g.,
Glossary) 
8.2 MPS constraints to ensure completeness of the EARS-based requirements
(hint: discuss some examples if something breaks) 
8.3 Test case generation process (step-by-step) that includes interfacing with
simulink, test case generation sequences, showing the results of the results as
inputs and output as the SimulinkResult model
