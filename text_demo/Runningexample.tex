\section{The Running Example: Automatic Sliding Door}
\label{sec:example}
\vspace{-.3cm}
Our running example for this demo is a sliding door system of PLC based
controller. The behavior of the sliding door controller is supposed to be as
follows: the sliding door opens if somebody enters by sensing the object using
the infrared sensor. The sliding door opens until the opening limits are
reached (also detected by the sensor). Upon reaching the opening limits the
count down timer starts. and the controller then closes the door when the timer
expires until the closing limit is reached detected by sensor.\levi{if we use a
different example we can just put the EARS requirements here without much
explanation also to show that EARS requirements are understandable on their
own}
