\section{The Running Example: Quiz Controller}
\label{sec:example}
\vspace{-.3cm}
Our running example for this demonstration is a controller for a system that
allows playing quiz games -- Quiz Controller (QC) for short. The QC's
function is to turn on the light indicator of the player than presses the answer
button first. Three groups, more specifically 2 pupils, 1 high school student
and 2 professors can play the game. There are 2 buttons for the pupils group, 1
button for the high school student group and 2 buttons for the professors
group. Such that the pupils are favored, either of the buttons can be pressed to turn on the
indicator. Regarding the professors group, both their buttons need to pressed
simultaneously such the indicator is turned on. We directly illustrate the
behavior of the controller that we are building as a set of \textsf{EARS-CTRL} requirements as shown in figure~\ref{fig:QC_reqs}.
Given \textsf{EARS-CTRL} is English, the requirements are self-explanatory.
