Our running example for this demo is a Quiz Controller (QC) system of
PLC\levi{I would not mention the plc controller} based controller. The behavior
of the sliding door controller is illustrated as a set of \textsf{EARS-CTRL} requirements for the software controller for a QC as shown in
figure~\ref{fig:QC_reqs}.
