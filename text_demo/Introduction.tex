\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) is an effective technique utilized
by many organizations (e.g., Rolce Royce and others) to build effective
requirements \cite{EARS}. Our tool is developed in Jetbrains MPS \cite{DBLP:conf/pppj/PechSV13}, a projectional meta editor for DSL development. 
The work presented here is an extension to our previous work on building complex
controller requirements model and automatic realisation of the EARS-based
requirements as actual controllers \cite{LucioRCA16}. In this demonstration, we
focus on providing a guidence to the users of our tool. A brief
installation information and links to the main github projects can be found at URL links of the projects [reference..].
An overview of the demonstration is as follows,
\begin{itemize}
  \item Progressively build a set of requirements for the controller
  \item Perform analysis to ensure correct building of the example case
  (whether the controller is synthesizable or not!!!) and correctness by
  construction\ldots
  \item Automatic realisation of the synthesized controller (one click approach)
  \item Simulation and test cases for performing conformance analysis
\end{itemize}
