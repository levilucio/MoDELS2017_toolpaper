In this demonstration we illustrate the main features of our \textsf{EARS-CTRL} tool \cite{EARSProject}.
An overview of the demonstration steps is as follows: \emph{1}) we
progressively build a set of requirements for a controller written as english
sentences using the EARS language \cite{EARS}; \emph{2}) we then automatically
synthesize a controller once the specification is sufficiently sound and
complete; and \emph{3}) we simulate and generate test case to
validate if the controller behavior behaves as expected.
Performing validation enables the user to find bugs/errors (e.g., missing
requirements) and provides reasoning to the user in order to correct
them\levi{does it?}.
