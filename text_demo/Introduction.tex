In this demonstration, we focus on providing a guidance to the users of our
tool. Our \textsf{EARS-CTRL} tool is a github project \cite{EARSProject}.
An overview of the demonstration steps is as follows, \emph{1})
progressively build a set of requirements for the controller written in english
like sentences using the EARS language \cite{EARS}, \emph{2}) automatic
synthesizing of the controller by analyzing if the specification is complete
(our one click approach) and \emph{3}) simulation and test case generation for
performing validation of the controller behavior if it behaves as expected.
Performing validation also enables the user to find bugs/errors (e.g., missing
requirements) and provides reasoning to the user in order to correct them.
