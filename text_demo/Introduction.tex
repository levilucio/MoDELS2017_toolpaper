In this demonstration, we illustrate the main features of our \textsf{EARS-CTRL}
tool \cite{EARSProject}.
An overview of the steps in our demonstration is as follows: \emph{1}) we
progressively build a set of requirements for a controller written as English
sentences using the EARS language \cite{EARS}; \emph{2}) we then automatically
synthesize a controller once the specification is sufficiently sound and
complete; and finally \emph{3}) we simulate and generate test case to
validate if the controller behavior behaves as expected.
