In this demonstration, we focus on providing a guidence to the users of our
tool. Our EARS-CTRL tool is a github project \cite{EARSProject}.
An overview of the demonstration steps is as follows,
\begin{itemize}
  \item Progressively build a set of requirements for the controller written in
  english like sentences using EARS lanaguage \cite{EARS}
  \item Automatic realisation of the controller by
  analyzing if the specification is complete (our one click approach)
  \item Simulation and test cases for performing conformance analysis between
  the EARS-based specification and the generated controller.
\end{itemize}
