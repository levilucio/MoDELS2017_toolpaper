In this demonstration, we focus on providing a guidence to the users of our
tool. Our \textsf{EARS-CTRL} tool is a github project \cite{EARSProject}.
An overview of the demonstration steps is as follows, \emph{1})
Progressively build a set of requirements for the controller written in english
like sentences using EARS lanaguage \cite{EARS}, \emph{2}) Automatic
synthesizing of the controller by analyzing if the specification is complete
(our one click approach) and \emph{3}) Simulation and test cases for performing
conformance analysis between the EARS-based specification and the generated controller. Performing analysis also enables the user to find bugs/errors (e.g., missing requirements) and provides reasoning to the user in order to correct them.
