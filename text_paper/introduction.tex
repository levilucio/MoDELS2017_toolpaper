\section{Introduction}

\levi{Talk about the rise of AI in program synthesis and formal methods and how
we enable requirements engineers to get closer to get closer to a code-free
program synthesis by providing an appropriate IDE} 

Note that the front-end of
the tool is based on the MPS (Meta-Programming System) meta-editor.

The contributions of this paper are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item EARS syntax:
\begin{itemize}
  \item components are now devices that can have sensors and actuators and are
  described in the glossary. This makes it for a more fluid English description. 
  \item until clauses have been removed from templates. 
\end{itemize}
\item{Synthesis}
\begin{itemize}
  \item lifting of error codes from the synthesizer. 
\end{itemize}
\item Simulation and test case generation.
\begin{itemize}
  \item interaction with simulink for simulation.
  \item interaction with simulink for text case generation
\end{itemize}

\levi{Where is EARS-CTRL available?}
